Welcome to the monorepo for the **Pulsar Engine**, the headless state management system for tracking Web3 transactions in the TUWA ecosystem.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Philosophy

Pulsar is the "brain" behind TUWA's transaction tracking capabilities. It's a **headless** engine, meaning it contains no UI components. Its sole purpose is to provide a robust, reliable, and extensible system for managing the lifecycle of on-chain transactions.

It is designed to be consumed by any UI layer, with our official implementation being the **[Nova UI Kit](https://github.com/TuwaIO/nova-uikit)**.

The architecture is modular:
-   **Core:** A framework-agnostic state machine.
-   **Adapters:** Platform-specific modules (e.g., for EVM chains).
-   **Connectors:** Framework-specific bindings (e.g., for React).

## üì¶ Packages in this Monorepo

## üöÄ Getting Started (for Contributors)

Follow these steps to set up the development environment on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/TuwaIO/pulsar-core.git](https://github.com/TuwaIO/pulsar-core.git)
cd pulsar-core
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
This project uses `pnpm`. Make sure you have it installed (`npm install -g pnpm`). Then run:
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Build All Packages
After installation, build all packages to ensure everything is linked correctly.
```bash
pnpm build
```

## üíª Development Workflow

For a logic-heavy library like Pulsar, testing is the primary development workflow.

### Running Tests
To run the test suite for all packages, use the following command from the root:
```bash
pnpm test
```
You can also run tests in watch mode for a specific package:
```bash
pnpm --filter @tuwaio/pulsar-evm test --watch
```

### Other Useful Commands
-   `pnpm lint`: Run the linter across all packages.
-   `pnpm format`: Format all code using Prettier.
-   `pnpm clean`: Remove all `node_modules` and `dist` folders.
