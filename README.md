Welcome to the official monorepo for the **Pulsar Engine**, a headless state management system for tracking Web3 transactions.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Philosophy

Pulsar is the "brain" behind TUWA's transaction tracking capabilities. It's a **headless** engine, meaning it contains no UI components. Its sole purpose is to provide a robust, reliable, and extensible system for managing the lifecycle of on-chain transactions across different blockchain ecosystems.

It is designed to be consumed by any UI layer, with our official implementation being the **[Nova UI Kit](https://github.com/TuwaIO/nova-uikit)**.

The architecture is modular and layered:

- üß† **Core (`@tuwaio/pulsar-core`):** A framework-agnostic state machine that knows _how_ to manage state but nothing about specific blockchains.
- üîå **Adapters (`@tuwaio/pulsar-evm`):** Platform-specific modules that plug into the core. They teach Pulsar _how_ to interact with a specific ecosystem (e.g., EVM chains via Viem).
- ‚öõÔ∏è **Bindings (`@tuwaio/pulsar-react`):** Framework-specific packages that provide hooks and utilities to easily connect Pulsar to a UI framework's lifecycle.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Framework-Agnostic Core:** Built with Zustand and Immer for maximum portability.
- **Multi-Chain by Design:** The adapter pattern allows for extending support to any blockchain.
- **Persistent State:** Automatically resumes tracking pending transactions after a page reload.
- **Rich EVM Support:** The official EVM adapter includes trackers for standard transactions, Safe multisigs, and Gelato meta-transactions.
- **Type-Safe:** Written entirely in TypeScript to ensure a robust developer experience.
