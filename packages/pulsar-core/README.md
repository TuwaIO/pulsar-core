The core, framework-agnostic engine for real-time tracking of Web3 transaction lifecycles (pending, success, failed, replaced).

## üèõÔ∏è What is `@tuwaio/pulsar-core`?

`@tuwaio/pulsar-core` is the central nervous system of the Pulsar transaction tracking engine. It is a **headless** and **framework-agnostic** library, meaning it contains no UI or framework-specific code (like React).

Its sole purpose is to provide a powerful state machine for managing transactions, built on top of **Zustand** and **Immer**. Think of it as a pre-configured, extensible "brain" that you can integrate into any JavaScript/TypeScript application.

This package exports one primary function: `createPulsarStore`.

## üíæ Installation

This package has `zustand` and `immer` as peer dependencies, so you must install them in your project.

```bash
pnpm add @tuwaio/pulsar-core zustand immer
```

## üöÄ API & Usage

### `createPulsarStore(config)`

This is the main factory function that creates your transaction store. It takes a configuration object and returns a ready-to-use Zustand store.

#### Configuration

```ts
import { createPulsarStore } from '@tuwaio/pulsar-core';
import { evmAdapter } from '@tuwaio/pulsar-evm'; // Example adapter

const pulsarStore = createPulsarStore({
  // Unique name for Zustand's persistence middleware (localStorage key)
  name: 'pulsar-storage',
  // An array of adapters for different blockchain ecosystems
  adapters: [
    evmAdapter(config, chains),
  ],
  // (Optional) Callbacks to execute on successful transaction
  onSucceedCallbacks: {
    onTxSucceed: (tx) => console.log('Transaction succeeded!', tx),
    onNotificationSucceed: (tx) => console.log('User notified of success!', tx),
  },
});
```

### The Returned Store

The `createPulsarStore` function returns a Zustand store with the following state and actions:

#### State
-   `transactionsPool: Record<string, T>`: The primary state object. A map of all tracked transactions, where the key is the transaction's unique `txKey`.
-   `initialTx?: InitialTransaction`: Holds the state of a transaction that is currently being initiated (e.g., waiting for a user's signature) but is not yet on-chain.
-   `lastAddedTxKey?: string`: The `txKey` of the most recently added transaction, useful for quick access.

#### Actions
-   `handleTransaction(params)`: The primary, all-in-one function for initiating, sending, and tracking a new transaction.
-   `initializeTransactionsPool()`: An async function to re-initialize trackers for any pending transactions stored from a previous session. Crucial for resuming tracking after a page reload.
-   `addTxToPool({ tx })`: Adds a new transaction directly to the tracking pool.
-   `updateTxParams(fields)`: Updates one or more properties of an existing transaction in the pool.
-   `removeTxFromPool(txKey)`: Removes a transaction from the pool by its key.
-   `closeTxTrackedModal(txKey?)`: Closes the tracking modal for a specific transaction and clears the `initialTx` state.

## ‚ú® How it Connects to the Ecosystem

-   **`@tuwaio/pulsar-core` (this package):** Provides the generic state machine (`createPulsarStore`).
-   **`@tuwaio/pulsar-evm`**: An adapter that plugs into the `adapters` config to provide EVM-specific logic.
-   **`@tuwaio/pulsar-react`**: Provides React bindings (`useInitializeTransactionsPool`) to easily reactivate tracking transactions after page reload.
