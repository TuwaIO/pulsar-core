# ActionTxKey

> **ActionTxKey** = `Hex` \| [`GelatoTxKey`](GelatoTxKey.md)

Defined in: [packages/pulsar-evm/src/types.ts:35](https://github.com/TuwaIO/pulsar-core/blob/6f58c3c9fd82323ffe7018d4cd8562c3905e9a91/packages/pulsar-evm/src/types.ts#L35)

A union type representing the unique identifier returned by an `actionFunction`
after a transaction is submitted to the network or a relay service.

This key is crucial for the EVM adapter to determine which tracker should
monitor the transaction.

It can be one of the following:
- A standard `0x...` transaction hash (`Hex`).
- A structured object from a relay service like Gelato (`GelatoTxKey`).
