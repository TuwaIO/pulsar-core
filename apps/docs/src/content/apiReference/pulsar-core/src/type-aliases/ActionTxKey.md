Defined in: [packages/pulsar-core/src/types.ts:52](https://github.com/TuwaIO/pulsar-core/blob/5f182e29003409398051d1d02ec9c947396d97e5/packages/pulsar-core/src/types.ts#L52)

A union type representing the unique identifier returned by an `actionFunction`
after a transaction is submitted to the network or a relay service.

This key is crucial for the adapter to determine which tracker should
monitor the transaction.

It can be one of the following:
- A standard `0x...` transaction hash (`Hex`).
- A Solana transaction signature (string).
