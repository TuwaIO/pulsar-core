Defined in: [packages/pulsar-core/src/types.ts:57](https://github.com/TuwaIO/pulsar-core/blob/e0149314d187da7baa08d06ba8554c6c4a303013/packages/pulsar-core/src/types.ts#L57)

A union type representing the unique identifier returned by an `actionFunction`
after a transaction is submitted to the network or a relay service.

This key is crucial for the adapter to determine which tracker should
monitor the transaction.

It can be one of the following:
- A standard `0x...` transaction hash (`Hex`).
- A Solana transaction signature (string).
