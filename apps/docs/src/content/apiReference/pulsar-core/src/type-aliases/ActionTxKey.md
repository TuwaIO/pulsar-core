Defined in: [packages/pulsar-core/src/types.ts:57](https://github.com/TuwaIO/pulsar-core/blob/18e5da55b3b8542aa1cb462dd015c6097e4ec4f0/packages/pulsar-core/src/types.ts#L57)

A union type representing the unique identifier returned by an `actionFunction`
after a transaction is submitted to the network or a relay service.

This key is crucial for the adapter to determine which tracker should
monitor the transaction.

It can be one of the following:
- A standard `0x...` transaction hash (`Hex`).
- A Solana transaction signature (string).
