# Introduction

<VideoPreview />

Welcome to the documentation for **Pulsar** 🚀 - TUWA's comprehensive solution for creating world-class transaction tracking experiences in your Web3 applications.

## The Challenge

Building a great Web3 user experience goes far beyond just submitting transactions to the blockchain. Modern dApp users expect:

- **Real-time updates** on their transaction status.
- **Clear visual feedback**, from pending to confirmation.
- **Robust error handling** with actionable retry options.
- **Multi-chain support** across different networks.
- **Beautiful interfaces** that don't feel like developer tools.

Building this tracking infrastructure manually is complex, time-consuming, and distracts from your core product features. Different wallet types, transaction replacements, network congestion, and cross-chain operations create a maze of edge cases that are difficult to handle correctly.

## Our Solution: Pulsar

**Pulsar** transforms transaction tracking from a complex technical challenge into a simple integration. We provide everything you need to deliver a seamless, professional transaction experience with just a few lines of code.

### 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

Our modular, adapter-based approach gives you maximum flexibility while maintaining simplicity:
