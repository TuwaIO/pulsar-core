# Library Comparison

This document provides a comparative analysis of the **Pulsar & Nova Suite** against other prominent solutions in the Web3 ecosystem. The goal is to highlight the unique value of each tool and demonstrate how they can be used together to build the best possible dApp.

## The Pulsar & Nova Suite

The **Pulsar & Nova Suite** is a complete, client-side system for tracking the entire transaction lifecycle (Standard, Safe, Gelato). It's a full-stack solution with a headless logic core (Pulsar) and a pre-built, themeable UI (Nova).

The Pulsar Core is designed to be extensible with dedicated adapters for different blockchain ecosystems. For EVM-compatible chains, you can use `@pulsar-core/pulsar-evm`, and for the Solana ecosystem, you can use `@pulsar-core/pulsar-solana`. These adapters easily integrate into the core to provide a consistent and robust transaction tracking experience across different chains. For Solana wallets, we recommend using the `@wallet-ui/core` library for wallet connection, which is perfectly compatible with the Pulsar suite.

## Wallet Connection Libraries

Most dApps use a dedicated library for wallet connection. **Pulsar is not a wallet connector**; it's a transaction tracker that works *with* your existing connection library. The table below shows how Pulsar complements these tools.

| Library | Transaction Tracking | Key Advantage | Synergy with Pulsar & Nova |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/)** | ✔️ **Limited.** Shows a list of recent transactions, but lacks a centralized state and advanced tracking features. | Best-in-class UI/UX for connecting wallets. Deeply integrated with `wagmi`. | ✅ **Perfect Match (EVM Only).** Use RainbowKit for its beautiful connection flow and Pulsar for a more powerful, persistent, and feature-rich transaction tracking system that works alongside it. |
| **[ConnectKit](https://family.co/docs/connectkit)** | ✔️ **Limited.** Provides a basic UI for transaction activity but no developer-accessible state pool. | Simple, clean, and highly customizable UI that easily adapts to your dApp's branding. | ✅ **Perfect Match (EVM Only).** Use ConnectKit for its elegant UI, and let Pulsar & Nova manage the complex state and notifications for all transactions in the background. |
| **[Dynamic.xyz](https://www.dynamic.xyz/)** | ❌ **No.** Focuses exclusively on authentication, authorization, and multi-wallet management. | A powerful, all-in-one solution for user authentication and session management. | ✅ **Perfect Match.** Use Dynamic for its robust user management features, and plug in Pulsar & Nova to handle the entire post-login transaction lifecycle. |
| **[Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io/)** | ❌ **No.** Primary focus is on non-custodial key management and social logins. | Simplifies user onboarding via Web2 methods (social logins, email) while retaining self-custody. | ✅ **Perfect Match.** Web3Auth is a great choice for onboarding. Pulsar & Nova can be integrated to manage all blockchain interactions after the user is authenticated. |

## Transaction Monitoring Solutions

This table compares the **Pulsar & Nova Suite** with other tools that offer transaction monitoring, highlighting its advantages as a native, client-side solution.

| Solution | Primary Focus | Architecture | Pricing | Key Distinction & Pulsar's Advantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pulsar & Nova Suite** | **Client-Side Tracking & UI** | **Native Client-Side:** Runs entirely in the browser using `viem` for RPC calls and `Zustand` for state. No external backend is required. | **Free & Open-Source** | **Complete Frontend Solution:** The only tool that bundles a headless state engine (Pulsar) with a pre-built UI library (Nova). It requires zero server infrastructure. |
| **[Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/)** | Low-Level Client Hooks | Native Client-Side Hooks | **Free & Open-Source** | **The Foundation.** Wagmi provides the building blocks. Pulsar is built *on top* of these blocks to deliver a complete, high-level product that handles state and edge cases for you. |
| **[Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/)** | All-in-One Platform | Client-side SDK with tightly integrated backend services. | **Freemium** | A comprehensive, walled-garden ecosystem. Pulsar is a more focused, unopinionated, and composable tool that integrates into *your* stack. |

### Final Conclusion

The **Pulsar & Nova Suite** occupies a unique and valuable position in the ecosystem. While other tools offer either low-level primitives or powerful—but often paid and backend-reliant—services, our suite provides a **complete, free, open-source, and purely client-side package**. With the addition of adapters for ecosystems like Solana, the suite extends its robust transaction tracking and UI capabilities, empowering developers to add a premium, multi-chain transaction tracking experience to their dApps with minimal effort.
