## Wallet Connection Libraries

Most dApps use a dedicated library for wallet connection. **Pulsar is not a wallet connector**; it's a transaction tracker that works *with* your existing connection library. The table below shows how Pulsar complements these tools.

| Library                                       | Transaction Tracking                                                                                                     | Key Advantage                                                                                             | Synergy with Pulsar & Nova                                                                                                                                              |

| **Pulsar & Nova Suite** | ✔️ **Yes.** A complete, client-side system for tracking the entire transaction lifecycle (Standard, Safe, Gelato).            | A full-stack solution with a headless logic core (Pulsar) and a pre-built, themeable UI (Nova).           | N/A                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **[RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/)** | ✔️ **Limited.** Shows a list of recent transactions, but lacks a centralized state and advanced tracking features.         | Best-in-class UI/UX for connecting wallets. Deeply integrated with `wagmi`.                               | ✅ **Perfect Match.** Use RainbowKit for its beautiful connection flow and Pulsar for a more powerful, persistent, and feature-rich tracking system that works alongside it. |
| **[ConnectKit](https://family.co/docs/connectkit)** | ✔️ **Limited.** Provides a basic UI for transaction activity but no developer-accessible state pool.                     | Simple, clean, and highly customizable UI that easily adapts to your dApp's branding.                     | ✅ **Perfect Match.** Use ConnectKit for its elegant UI, and let Pulsar & Nova manage the complex state and notifications for all transactions in the background.            |
| **[Dynamic.xyz](https://www.dynamic.xyz/)** | ❌ **No.** Focuses exclusively on authentication, authorization, and multi-wallet management.                             | A powerful, all-in-one solution for user authentication and session management.                           | ✅ **Perfect Match.** Use Dynamic for its robust user management features, and plug in Pulsar & Nova to handle the entire post-login transaction lifecycle.                |
| **[Web3Onboard](https://web3onboard.thirdweb.com/)** | ⚠️ **Deprecated.** Previously offered notifications, but this feature is no longer supported.                          | Framework-agnostic with extensive wallet support (over 35 options).                                       | ✅ **Perfect Match.** Use Web3Onboard for its wide wallet support, and integrate Pulsar & Nova to provide the missing transaction tracking experience.                 |
| **[Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io/)** | ❌ **No.** Primary focus is on non-custodial key management and social logins.                                           | Simplifies user onboarding via Web2 methods (social logins, email) while retaining self-custody.          | ✅ **Perfect Match.** Web3Auth is a great choice for onboarding. Pulsar & Nova can be integrated to manage all blockchain interactions after the user is authenticated.    |

It requires zero server infrastructure. |
| **[Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/)** | Low-Level Client Hooks        | Native Client-Side Hooks                                                                                                                    | **Free & Open-Source** | **The Foundation.** Wagmi provides the building blocks.
