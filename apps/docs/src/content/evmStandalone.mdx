# Using EVM Trackers Standalone

While the Pulsar suite offers a full stack solution with a UI (`@tuwaio/nova-transactions`) and a Zustand-based state store (`@tuwaio/pulsar-core`), its architecture remains modular and flexible. This means you can utilize the low-level **trackers** (`evmTracker`, `gelatoFetcher`, `safeFetcher`) from `@tuwaio/pulsar-evm` directly, without installing or configuring the complete state management store.

This flexibility is ideal if:

- You already have your own state management solution (Redux, MobX, Valtio, etc.) and want to integrate only the transaction tracking logic.
- You require tracking on the server-side, where a client-centric store isn't necessary.
- You desire granular control over each stage of a transaction’s lifecycle for custom workflows.

## Why Use `evmTracker`?

Some might ask, "Why should I use `evmTracker` when I can just call `waitForTransactionReceipt` from `viem`?" While `waitForTransactionReceipt` is effective, it only addresses part of the problem. `evmTracker` provides a more robust, comprehensive, and ready-to-use solution.

| Feature                     | `waitForTransactionReceipt` (viem)                                                                     | `evmTracker` (Pulsar)                                                                                                                             |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Handles RPC Lags**       | ❌ No. If called immediately after submission, the RPC node might not have indexed the transaction yet, causing errors. | ✅ **Yes.** Built-in retry mechanism to wait for the transaction to appear in the mempool, mitigating RPC delays.                              |
| **Full Lifecycle Support** | 🤷‍♂️ Limited. Mainly reacts once the transaction is confirmed or replaced.                              | ✅ **Yes.** Provides callbacks for each stage: initialization, details fetched, mined, replaced, failed, etc.                              |
| **Fetches Full Tx Details** | ❌ No. Doesn't return complete info such as nonce, value, etc.                                | ✅ **Yes.** Calls `getTransaction` internally, passing all transaction details to callbacks.                                               |
| **Abstraction Level**       | Low. You must manage the tracking states manually.                                                    | High. Encapsulates the entire process into a single, convenient async function, simplifying implementation.                                |

In essence, `evmTracker` is a reliable wrapper around `viem` functions, addressing common edge cases and significantly reducing manual effort.

## Trackers Overview

### 1. EVM Tracker

This is the primary tracker for monitoring standard transactions on EVM-compatible chains, identified via transaction hash.

#### How It Works

`evmTracker` initially fetches transaction details using `getTransaction`. If unavailable (due to RPC indexing delay), it retries several times. Once the details are available, it actively waits for the transaction receipt using `waitForTransactionReceipt`.

#### Example Usage
```tsx
import { evmTracker } from '@tuwaio/pulsar-evm';
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains';

async function trackMyTransaction(txHash) {
  console.log(`Starting to track transaction: ${txHash}`);
  await evmTracker({
    chains: [mainnet], // Chains array for internal client creation
    tx: {
      txKey: txHash, // Transaction hash
      chainId: 1, // Chain ID (e.g., 1 for Ethereum Mainnet)
    },
    onTxDetailsFetched: (txDetails) => {
      console.log('Transaction details received:', txDetails);
      // Update your UI/state with nonce, gas, etc.
    },

    onSuccess: (txDetails, receipt) => {
      console.log('Transaction mined!', receipt);
      if (receipt.status === 'success') {
        // Update status as successful
      } else {
        // Update status as failed
      }
    },

    onReplaced: (replacement) => {
      console.log('Transaction was replaced:', replacement);
      // Handle replacement logic
    },

    onFailure: (error) => {
      console.error('Tracking failed:', error);
      // Handle errors
    },
  });
}
```

### 2. Gelato & Safe Fetchers

For polling-based tracking, especially for **Gelato** and **Safe** multisig transactions, we expose fetcher functions. You can integrate these directly with Pulsar's `initializePollingTracker` or your custom polling setup.

#### Example for Handling Gelato & Safe Transactions
```tsx
import { initializePollingTracker } from '@tuwaio/pulsar-core';
import { gelatoFetcher, safeFetcher } from '@tuwaio/pulsar-evm';

// Tracking a Gelato relay task
async function trackGelatoTask(taskId) {
  await initializePollingTracker({
    tx: { txKey: taskId },
    fetcher: gelatoFetcher,
    onSuccess: (status) => {
      console.log('Gelato task succeeded:', status);
    },
    onFailure: (status) => {
      console.error('Gelato task failed:', status);
    },
  });
}

// Tracking a Safe multisig transaction
async function trackSafeTx(safeTxHash, chainId, fromAddress) {
  await initializePollingTracker({
    tx: { txKey: safeTxHash, chainId, from: fromAddress },
    fetcher: safeFetcher,
    onSuccess: (status) => {
      console.log('Safe transaction succeeded:', status);
    },
    onFailure: (status) => {
      console.error('Safe transaction failed:', status);
    },
    onReplaced: (replacement) => {
      console.warn('Transaction was replaced:', replacement);
    },
  });
}
```

## Helper Functions

Additionally, the package provides several utilities for managing transaction states and chain interactions:

### `checkTransactionsTracker`

Determines which tracker is suitable based on a transaction key.
```tsx
import { checkTransactionsTracker } from '@tuwaio/pulsar-evm';

const { tracker, txKey } = checkTransactionsTracker('0xabc...', 'injected');
// tracker -> 'ethereum' or relevant tracker type
// txKey -> same as input or derived key
``` 

### `checkChainForTx`

Verifies if the user is connected to the correct network and prompts for a switch if necessary.
```tsx
import { checkChainForTx } from '@tuwaio/pulsar-evm';
import { wagmiConfig } from './config';

async function ensureCorrectNetwork(chainId: number | string) {
  try {
    await checkChainForTx(chainId, wagmiConfig);
    console.log('Network is correct, proceeding...');
    // Proceed with your transaction or other logic here
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
    // Handle error, e.g., showing a message to the user about network mismatch
  }
}
```
