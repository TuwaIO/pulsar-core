# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the essential steps to integrate the **Pulsar** engine into your existing React application.

By the end of this guide, you will have a fully functional system for tracking and displaying user transactions across multiple blockchain ecosystems, including:

  - A headless state management store powered by **`@tuwaio/pulsar-core`**.
  - EVM chain support via **`@tuwaio/pulsar-evm`**.
  - Solana support via **`@tuwaio/pulsar-solana`**.

Let's begin.
